# I was in a bad mood today.

Rainy day. busy. bad.. but good

I had a hard time at work today.  
They are very rude to those who are less experienced.  
But, There is a point in what they say.
They told me I had a lot of excuses.  
Yeah.. sadly, It's true.  
I have a lot of excuses, regardless of their rudeness.  
And then I came home and I read the Bible.  
The Bible says this.

>Be joyful always  
>pray continually  
>give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.

Yes, right.  
I have to pray for them, and for myself.
