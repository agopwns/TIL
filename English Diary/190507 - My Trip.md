# My Trip

It Was cool.  
Because It hasn't rained for two days.  
This is really uncommon in Taipei.  
I went to Shifen and Tamsui.  
Shifen is a journey course made up of railroad tracks.  
The natrue of the mountain was really beatiful.  
Tamsui is a riverside, and it was a graet place to hang out with Taiwan.  
Especially the food was delicious.  
Everything is soooo cool.  
I was very satisfied this trip.
