# Wasted my time.

Rainy. Not good.  

4/30. I was scheduled to go to Taipei.  
But, the flight was canceled due to a glitch.  
The airline offered the hotel, airplane tickets the next day, 
and compensation.  
  
I liked the airline's quick response and proper compensation.  
But, it's a real shame that I spent less time with my girlfriend.  
I'm sure I'll be with my girlfriend today.
